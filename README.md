Bright Eyes
==========

Welcome to the fabulous Bright Eyes code project.
This is where you will find:

* Software to convert you're awesome videos to playback on the glasses
* Software to control the glasses
* A precompiled application to convert the videos

Do check out the READMEs on both the Processing Converter and Arduino SDPlayer for more details.
This project will be updated very soon to also include more demos and examples.

The converter uses two libraries you should download first if you plan to edit the source:
